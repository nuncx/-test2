# Profiles (local, untracked)

This folder holds local runtime profiles (JSON) for RSPS Color Bot v3.

By default, all `*.json` files here are ignored by Git to prevent leaking sensitive or machine-specific settings.

If you need to share a profile, create a sanitized example and commit it under a different name (e.g., `example_profile.json`) and update documentation accordingly.
